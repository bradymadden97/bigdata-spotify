Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks  'Cause she loves danger, psychopath And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that But she's devised some plan To stab him in the back, knife in hand Says the relationship's hanging by a strand  So she's been on the web lately Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, despite her man And I know she's using me to try to play him I don't care, hi Susanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Susanne" After the first night, but tonight I am  I've been a liar, been a thief Been a lover, been a cheat All my sins need holy water Feel it washing over me  Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something If all it's gonna cause is pain Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain So let the river run  One-night stand, turned into night staying He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and He found out, now she feels deserted and used 'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too  Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through? It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued And witnessed you hurt, but what you deserve is the truth Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you  So I revert to the studio like hole in the wall diners Don't have to be reserved in a booth I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew  And now that I got you I don't want you Took advantage of my thirst to pursue Why do I do this dirt that I do? Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech Detergent and bleach is burning the wound 'Cause now with her in the womb We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit Fuck  I've been a liar, been a thief Been a lover, been a cheat All my sins need holy water Feel it washing over me  Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something If all it's gonna cause is pain Truth in my lies now are falling like the rain So let the river run  My name's (oh), my name's (oh) Denver (oh), river run Call me (oh), call me (oh) River (oh), we'll let the river run  Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, hey Fuck can I say? If life was a highway The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe  That's why I may have came at you sideways I can't keep my lies straight What I made you terminate, my baby This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled  What else can I say? It was fun for a while Bet I really woulda loved your smile Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it What's one more lie to tell an unborn child?  I've been a liar, been a thief Been a lover, been a cheat All my sins need holy water Feel it washing over me  Oh, little one (I'm sorry) I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up) If all it's gonna cause is pain The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain So let the river run|
